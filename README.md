# Autonomous Driving with Neural Networks
Self Driving project incorporating artificial intelligence and neural networks. 


This independent project uses neural networks to navigate the car through the traffic and finding the best optimal path. I have set the start count of cars to a 1000 and have said cars navigate through the traffic to find the optimal path. On the right, there are buttons to save this best optimal path and there are buttons to add 1 car to the traffic or 2 cars to add a random number of cars to a random position on the road. Each car is equipped with sensors and if the car hits either the traffic or the borders, it is eliminated. The car with the best path will be prioritized (highlighted blue). 

This project was a great learning experience for me as it was my first project incorporating neural networks. I have previously spent time obtaining certificates in neural networks and machine learning and was very excited to create a project that incorporates such. 

Edit:
* I have added a button where we can add a car to the road where the user can control the movement of this car. This helps show how the ai controlled car reacts to a user driving near it. This simulates an automated car driving on a road with physical drivers.
